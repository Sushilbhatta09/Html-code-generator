# Automatic-HTML-Code-Generation-Using-LSTM-and-CNN
In this era of artificial intelligence generating the code automatically is one of the hot topic in this field. 
Automatic html code generator is capable of generating the mark up language by sending the hand made wireframe. 
This generator model is able to identify the tags with the convolutional neural network and memorize the sequence with the Long short term memory(LSTM) and able to predict the tags on the wireframe and recreate the website. 
We have used own hand made dataset with data preprocessing is done. We have used the architecture of Tony Beltramelli, pix to code paper which was published in back 2017, where he and his team has used synthetic website as the dataset.
